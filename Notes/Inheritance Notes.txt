Notes
--------

1. A Super class reference varaible can store all its 
   implementation class objects
2. A sub class reference variable cannot store super class
   object
3. The  reference of the super class can be used to access 
   all methods in the super class and common methods(a    methood which is avaiable both in super and sub class/    overridden methods)
4. The reference of super class cannot be used to access    individual methods( a method which is not avaiable in    super class and avaible in sub class) of the sub class


Method overridding visibility scopes
-----------------------------------------
1. When super class method is public, then sub class    overriden methods must be public
2. When super class method is default, then sun class    overridden method can be default, public and protected
3. When Super class method is protected, then sub class         overridden method can be protected and public
4. When super class method is private, then  sub class cannot    have the visibility of private methods
